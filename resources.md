		<h6>Learning Code Basics</h6>
		<dl>
			<a href="http://www.codecademy.com"><dt>Code Academy</dt></a>
			<dd>This is a great first stop for most coding basics. These courses explain concepts as you go, whereas some other sites are more "do first, explain later."</dd>
			<a href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/"><dt>Learn Ruby the Hard Way</dt></a>
			<dd>Ruby the Hard Way has many, many exercises. I think it is most helpful after completing Ruby on Code Academy. It's great practice and helps ingrain concepts, but is less helpful in explaining concepts.</dd>
			<a href="http://www.codeschool.com"><dt>Code School</dt></a>
			<dd>Code School is similar to Code Academy. However, while it does have some free courses, a lot of the site is subscripion-based. Code School is not quite as beginner-friendly as Code Academy.</dd>

		<h6>Cheatsheets and Quick Reference</h6>
		<dl>
			<a href="http://www.pragtob.info/rails-beginner-cheatsheet/"><dt>Rails Beginner Cheatsheet</dt></a>
			<dd>This covers basics like strings, hashes, and arrays. It assumes that you've already been introduced to the concepts, but can provide another viewpoint, as well as a quick lookup for commands.</dd>
			<a href="http://gitref.org/"><dt>Git Reference</dt></a>
			<dd>This should be your first stop when you forget a Git command.</dd>
