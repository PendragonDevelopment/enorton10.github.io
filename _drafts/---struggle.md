Struggles: Not wanting to ask for help
Knowing that the coding community expects you to figure as much out for your self as possible
Getting stuck on one problem (formatting my blog) and letting that block me on everything else. The moment that using Foundation clicked was a like a clog in a drain shifted. All of a sudden I could think again.
Hearing the words "This option is good and simpler" and "This option is better, but more complicated" and automatically taking the more dificult option. Cause I'm sure it's not THAT much harder. I'm sure I can figure it out. I pretty much already know the simpler version anyway (I didn't.) I might as well learn that other way that's better.
Watching Sublime repeatedly delete files I had spent half an hour working on.
Helps: Not trying to write to the site directory. That helps a lot. A LOT.
Writing notes (Whaaaat? Crazy talk. This is computer shit. This is lines and lines of computer shit.)
Marking everything I don't understand
Making notes of things to explore more
Writing questions when I can't figure something out on my own
Admitting that sometimes simpler is better even if it's not. Sometimes good is good enough. Especially when it's the difference between forward momentum and remaining stalled.
Resolution: Be willing to reach out sooner and ask more questions, especially when bogged down or clogged
Be willing to change my mind when something isn't working
Note to self: this is a good answer when someone asks "What is your greatest challenge?" or "What do you feel is your greatest weakness?"
