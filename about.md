I loved coffee before I could form sentences, so working at Starbucks seemed a natural part of my personal evolution. The idea of learning to code was less instinctive for me, but an hour into my first CodeAcademy course I realized that I hadn't been giving myself enough credit. Right now, I'm getting comfortable with HTML, CSS, Jekyll, and Foundation. Javascript makes me distinctly UNcomfortable and I'm in the midst of a Ruby on Rails course.
